Implementation of the Strategy Design Pattern
Assignment where we need to implement the following
scenario:

You have a product named T-Shirt that has three (3) variations, in terms
of,
1. Color, {RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, INDIGO, VIOLET} [5 marks]
2. Size, {XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL} 
3. Fabric, {WOOL, COTTON, POLYESTER, RAYON, LINEN, CASHMERE, SILK} 
Each variation gets a different price tag.

Also, each product can be paid via three (3) different payment methods,
1. Credit / Debit cards 
2. Money / Bank Transfer 
3. Cash 

Construct a Strategy pattern that implements the variations and the payment
methods under three (3) combined strategies that implement all the possible
combinations as such:
1. Color, Size and Fabric with Credit / Debit Cards 
2. Color, Size and Fabric with Money / Bank Transfer 
3. Color, Size and Fabric with Cash
